# Server Errors Processing with try{} catch{}

This repository contains a simple Node.js server that demonstrates how to handle server errors using `try{} catch{}`. The server is available at `localhost:3000`. To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Download the folder with the assignment materials.
2. Open the folder in your terminal.
3. Run the command `npm start` to start the server.

This example showcases how to handle server errors gracefully, ensuring that your server remains stable and responsive. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own projects.
